== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which shortcodes are included? =

* `[wpsight_listings]`: Displays a list of your latest properties
* `[wpsight_listings_search]`: Displays the property search form
* `[wpsight_listing]`: Displays a single listing
* `[wpsight_listing_teasers]`: Displays a list of property teasers
* `[wpsight_listing_teaser]`: Displays a single property teaser
* `[wpsight_listings_map]`: Displays a Map with all your listings as markers if they have a location assigned

For more information about shortcodes please [read our documentation](https://docs.wpcasa.com/article/shortcodes/).

= Where can I change currency, measurements, etc.? =

You can fit general plugin settings to your needs on _WP-Admin > WPCasa > Settings > [tab] Listings_. Things like listing ID prefix, measurement unit, currency, standard listing details, rental periods and more can be set here.

= Is WPCasa free? =

Yes, the core features are free. Additionally, we offer free and paid add-ons and themes exclusively built for WPCasa.

= Does WPCasa support the block editor (aka Gutenberg)? =

Let's say yes, but don't expect blocks to build your pages. With WPCasa 1.4.0 we have added block editor support (which needs to be enabled in the WPCasa settings) which allows you to use all WPCasa related data in the block editor. This allows you to create your own output with the loop block, for example.
However, you can still use our [shortcodes](https://docs.wpcasa.com/article/category/shortcodes/) with the block editor.

= Does WPCasa include a listing gallery? =

Yes and no. WPCasa provides the data structure for an image gallery for listings. However, WPCasa does not have a gallery for output in the frontend. The reason is that the theme usually provides galleries. We want to avoid having to load the code for different galleries on one page. The developer of the theme must therefore ensure compatibility with WPCasa and can then activate the addition of images for the gallery. Otherwise, only the featured image can be added to the listing.

= Do you use a third Party or external service? =

We do not use any third Party providers or external services, but on the backend pages `WPCasa > Add-Ons`, `WPCasa > Themes` and `WPCasa > Licenses` we load some information from our URL wpcasa.com. This is just to provide you with the latest information for further downloads. So that you have the opportunity to adapt WPCasa to your needs. We do not collect personal information or track your behavior. It's just about providing you with better service. If you do not want this, please do not open the mentioned pages! WPCasa also works without you having to visit the sites.

= Why do you use external services?  =

We do call Google Maps when you view the listing map where we have placed the listings on it. For this you have to add your Google Maps key.
We call (goqr.me)[https://goqr.me/] when you print a listing. This service allows us to add a QR code on the last page.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

The translations are handled on WordPress.org. Please be part of the community and help to translate WPCasa on [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpcasa/). Thank you!

= Is WPCasa running with PHP 8+? =

Yes. Since version 1.2.12 we call WPCasa PHP 8+ compatible. Not optimized, but runs fine with PHP 8+ (which is what we've noticed so far).
In the future, we will improve the codebase to gradually adopt and optimize it for PHP 8.

= How can I contribute? =

= 1.3.0 =
We have changed the loading of the language files of [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpcasa/). This means that the language files included in the plugin are no longer available. If you find that the WPCasa output is now in English instead of your local language, please go to [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wpcasa/) and translate WPCasa into your local language. This way the community can benefit from your translation, just as you benefit from WPCasa.
Please note: WordPress 6.6 has dropped support for PHP 7.0 and 7.1, so in the upcoming updates we will also drop PHP support for older and unsecure PHP versions up to PHP 7.1. If you would like to benefit from further WPCasa updates from the end of 2024, please keep in mind that you must be running at least PHP 7.2 on your server.

= 1.2.13 =
We have fixed the non-functioning QR code on the single page and made sure that WPCasa works correctly with WordPress 6.6.

This version is now compatible with PHP8+ and we fixed a styling issue with the popup of Listings Map.
Please note: WordPress 6.6 will drop support for PHP 7.0 and 7.1, so in the upcoming updates we will also start dropping PHP support for older and unsecure PHP versions up to PHP 7.1.
